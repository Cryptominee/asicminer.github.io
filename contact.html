An ASIC miner is a piece of equipment that is purposely-built solely for mining. Unlike other types of mining devices, ASICs can only be used to mine cryptos and nothing else.</div>
<div class="sc-bdfBwQ Text-msjfkz-0 Renderer___StyledText-mfgg8t-4 fAerDW">Mining is an activity that is required by a&nbsp;proof-of-work&nbsp;(PoW) blockchain to carry out its operations. It involves making complex calculations to solve a mathematical puzzle, which miners compete in order to earn a&nbsp;block reward.</div>

<p>Mining is the process of managing the blockchain and also creating new bitcoins. The job of bitcoin miners is to review and verify previous bitcoin transactions, and then to create a new block so the information can be added to the blockchain. The mining process involves solving complex mathematical problems using intrinsic hash functions linked to the&nbsp;block&nbsp;that contains the transaction data. Various bitcoin miners compete intensely with each other to solve a necessary mathematical puzzle.</p>
